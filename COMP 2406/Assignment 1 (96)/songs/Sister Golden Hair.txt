Sister Golden Hair -America
verse1:
Well I [E] tried to make it sunday but I [G#min] got so damned depressed
That I [A] set my sights on [E] monday and I [G#min] got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the alter, but I [C#min] do [G#min] believe there's [A] times
When a [F#min] woman sure can [A] be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E]
